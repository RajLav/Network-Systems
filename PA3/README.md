**Run this file**  
./webproxy2

**Features Included :**  

Multithreading - In this , multiple clients can access the server at the same time. It is implemented with the help of forking method

Caching- If the data of the website exists in the folder of cache then the data will be recovered from that instead of getting it from the server.

Page cache - It checks if a page exists in the proxy before retrieving a page from a remote server. If there is a valid cached copy of the page, that is returned to the
client instead of creating a new server connection. Local file is created to store retrieved page based MD5sum of the url. New folder is created for 
every new host.

Hostnameâ€™ IP address cache - If same hostname is requested again, my proxy server skips the DNS query to reduce DNS query time. 

Blocked websites are written in the blocked websites txt file.
